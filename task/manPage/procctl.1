.SS \f[B]Signals List\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
SIGHUP - signal is reloading configuration and restarting process
.PP
   *   *   *   *   *
.IP \[bu] 2
SIGINT - signal is commonly used to request the termination of a process
in a controlled manner, allowing the process to clean up and exit
gracefully.
.PP
   *   *   *   *   *
.IP \[bu] 2
SIGQUIT - signal is commonly used to request the termination of a
process in a manner that allows for debugging and analysis of its state
at the time of termination.
.PP
   *   *   *   *   *
.IP \[bu] 2
SIGTRAP - signal is primarily used by debuggers to interrupt a process
in order to perform debugging operations such as setting breakpoints,
tracing system calls, or handling errors.
It is not commonly used in regular application programming
.PP
   *   *   *   *   *
.IP \[bu] 2
SIGABRT - signal is typically used to indicate an abnormal termination
condition and is often raised in response to critical errors or failures
that require the process to be terminated in a controlled manner.
.PP
   *   *   *   *   *
.IP \[bu] 2
SIGKILL - signal is a powerful tool for forcefully terminating processes
that are unresponsive or misbehaving.
However, it should be used carefully due to its immediate and
unignorable nature.
.PP
   *   *   *   *   *
.IP \[bu] 2
SIGTERM - signal is commonly used to request a process to terminate in a
controlled and graceful manner, allowing it to clean up resources and
perform any necessary actions before exiting.
It is a standard way to stop a process without abruptly ending its
execution.
.PP
   *   *   *   *   *
.IP \[bu] 2
SIGCONT - signal is used to resume the execution of a stopped or paused
process, allowing it to continue running.
It is commonly used in scenarios where processes need to be temporarily
halted and then resumed based on external events or user interactions
.PP
   *   *   *   *   *
.IP \[bu] 2
SIGSTOP - signal is used to pause (suspend) the process
